# 1.0.1 (Fri Sept 1 2023) -- Brand new CLI!

### Summary

This is the first major release update since the initial release,
mainly due to breaking changes in the command line interface.

Most of the changes were included in https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/309,
summarised as:
- update API to entrypoint per command: `create`, `add`, `validate`, `serve`, `get`, `set`, `remove`, `translate`, `workflow`
- introduce `datalad-next` dependency, at first for constraint system but in future for whatever functionality is useful
- refactor most of the code related to the main commands

Some of the important changes to take note of:

- Validation is now done according to the schema of a specific catalog (now located at `path-to-catalog/schema/*`), where previously validation was always done according to the latest schema of the installed package version (which is now the fallback).
- Metadata can be passed to any catalog command that takes it as in argument, in different formats: json lines from STDIN, JSON-serialized string, and a file with JSON lines.
- pytest fixtures are now located in `tests/fixtures.py` and exposed to all tests
- `catalog-get|set` provides an extensible set of commands for configuring a catalog and reporting its properties
- the handling of config files is refactored:
   - The main changes relate to how/when a config file is provided.
   - Previously, config files were specified during instantiation of the WebCatalog class, and a whole lot of obscure code was necessary to determine how this config applies to the catalog or dataset level.
   - The refactored code receives the config file via the Create() and Add() commands or via the WebCatalog.create() or Node.add_attributes() python methods.
   - Now, WebCatalog can be instantiated with location alone (no 'action'  necessary anymore, and no config_file)
   - Now, config is set on WebCatalog or Node instances after/during  running their respective create() methods and not during instantiation
- Translation functionality is refactored, and *requires updated to existing translators*:
   - With the new catalog argument, translation occurs to the specific schema version of the catalog (if  supported by an available translator); if the catalog argument is not supplied, the expected schema version is the latest supported by the package installation.
   - The translator matching process is streamlined by keeping track of previously matched and instantiated translators
   - Functionality to get the supported schema version, source name, and source version have been moved to the translator base class in order to support the abovementioned changes. This means existing and new translators will have to override these functions.
