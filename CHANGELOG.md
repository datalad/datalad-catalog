# 1.1.1 (Mon Jan 22 2024) -- Buggy configgy

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix config-related issues picked up in handbook tutorial. PR [413](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/413) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):
   - removes unused `config/config.yml` file
   - makes the metadata source rules in the default config file (`config/config.json`) more permissive by removing custom sources such as `metalad_studyminimeta` from the rules; ssentially, all fields are "first come first served" or "merge any".
   - fix the bug where `WebCatalog.get_config()` fetched the incorrect file (default package config instead of the catalog's actual config); the method now fetches the config file of the catalog.
   - Ensure that the JS-loaded config (from catalog or from dataset) has the minimum required fields as defined by the default in JS, which prevents related browser-based errors
   - not a bug fix but part of the same PR: remove double yielding of `add` commands when creating a catalog and adding metadata at the same time.
- Define default social links in javascript default config instead of making them null. PR [414](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/414) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):

# 1.1.0 (Tue Jan 9 2024) -- UX improvements and internals

### Summary

- This release mostly contains improvements to the UI/UX side of the catalog, such as optimized rendering of components and the addition of new buttons/displays.
- A notable addition is the ability to render rich semantic information in a dedicated tab, including (links to) term definitions.
- Several internal functions were refactored to remove redundant code or allow 
- datalad-catalog api calls can now also receive a Python dictionary as metadata input (e.g. `add` and `validate`)

### üí´ Enhancements and new features

- ENH: adds a "request access" button for a dataset. PR [#235](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/235) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis))
- ENH: Fine tuning of HTML rendering. PR [#347](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/347) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):
   - hides fields, including properties, journal, and grant description, if they are not populated, to prevent empty properties from making the rendered page ugly
   - improves parsing of objects and arrays in the additional display tab so that they can be rendered in a more visually pleasing way.
- ENH: Changes approach for setting the required tabs from URL parameters. PR [#358](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/358) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):
   - discards the use of `$refs` for finding available tabs because of an issue with asynchronous loading of `$root`, the dataset component and its subcomponents, and `$refs`. It can happen that `$refs` might or might not be defined at the time when `created()` or `mounted()` is called in the vue app life cycle. For a more useful description, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54355375/vue-js-refs-are-undefined-even-though-this-refs-shows-theyre-there.
   - instead determines the available tabs from the root component data, and accesses this list both on `created()` and on `beforeRouteUpdate()` in order to check the provided URL parameter against this list.
- ENH: Update icons and social media links by using font-awesome 6.4.2, replacing twitter with X, and adding mastodon. PR [#366](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/366) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis))
- ENH: Let the binder button display for all datasets and not only for datasets with a github URL; also update the binder link to point to the main branch of the relevant repo. PR [#367](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/367) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis))
- NF: Introduce a dataset back button. The additions introduce changes to html (to show and hide the back button), to css (for the back button styling together with home button and dataset title), and to JS. The latter handles logic for when to show and hide the back button. Upon `create()` the superdataset file is fetched in order to store the `id` and `version` on the component, and the back button is hidden. Upon internal navigation (using `beforeRouteUpdate()`), the JS checks if the route that is navigated to is the same as the home page by comparing the new `id` and `version` to the stored super id and version. If they are different, show the back button; if they are the same, hide the back button. PR [#368](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/368) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis))
- ENH: Display "last updated" as 'unknown' if the corresponding field is empty (previously an empty value was displayed as an ugly 'NaN'). PR [#369](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/369) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis))
- ENH: Content tab UI tweaks. PR [#369](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/369) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):
   - The cloud icon as a means to download a file is removed
   - Filename is turned into a link, if the file has an associated URL and only if the URL string contains http
   - the file size is updated to display correctly (empty string, and not NaN, if the value is empty)
   - the cursor will only turn into a pointer if the item is a folder or a file with a link.. PR [#369](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/369) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis))
- ENH: Update functionality wrt subdataset display / behaviour / filtering. PR [#373](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/373) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):
   - Fixes subdataset filtering to filter on `name`, `givenName`, and `familyName` provided that the property value in each case is not `null`.
   - Update subdataset filtering behaviour to only show filtering options when the number of `subdatasets > 3`. This will hide the filtering options otherwise. Additionally, if the filtering options are hidden, the tags on each subdataset will be deactivated (still visible, but not clickable)
   - Clears filtering options (filtering text, selected filter tags) when navigating to a subdataset, both from the subdataset view and the content aka file tree view. This prevents the filtering options from remaining and subsequently filtering the subdatasets of the recently selected dataset (after filtering).
- ENH: Linked data rendering in `additional_display` tab. PR [#405](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/405) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):
   - A new async component is introduced to encapsulate any rendering of `additional_tab_display`s that have an `@context` key in their `content` field. The component was created to remove specific implementation details related to semantics from the overall dataset page rendering (i.e. from the dataset-template component). This allows for future changes to the semantic tab rendering without affecting how the component is invoked.
   - see previous work by [@mslw](https://github.com/mslw) at https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/sfb1451-projects-catalog/pull/62/files: 
- ENH: Adds improved logic to the function called when user selects the catalog home button (when the current location is any tab on any dataset page in a catalog). PR [#394](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/394) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):
   - If there is NO home page set:
      - if there is a tab name in the URL, navigate to current
      - else: don't navigate, only reset
   - If there IS a home page set:
      - if the current page IS the home page:
         - if there is a tab name in the URL, navigate to current
         - else: don't navigate, only reset
      - if the current page is NOT the home page, navigate to home (reset = clear filters and set tab index = 0)
- ENH: adds ability to specify default tab display via dataset-level config file (e.g. `"dataset_options"["default_tab"] = "subdatasets"`). PR [#397](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/397) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):
   - the content tab is displayed in position 0
   - the subdatasets tab is displayed in position 1
   - other standard / non-standard tabs follow in their original order
   - if no default tab is specified via the dataset-level config, the content tab is shown
   - if a different default tab is provided via dataset-level config, that tab will be shown
- ENH: Allow python dictionaries to be passed as `metadata` argument, (e.g. for `add` and `validate`). PR [#403](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/403) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis))

### ü™ì Deprecations and removals

- BF: Fix file download url rendering, where the previous state resulted in the download url for a file only containing the first letter of a string (i.e. `url_string[0]`) because it tested for the existence of an array incorrectly. PR [#343](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/343) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis))
- BF: Tabs and buttons. PR [#350](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/350) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):
   - reverts automatic tab switching to its original functionality: displaying the first tab whether it has content or not
   - fixes the faulty positioning of the "request access" button in the case where no other dataset buttons are displayed

### üè† Internal

- Add schema utility functions that can be used in a more streamlined way by Python applications. PR [#378](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/378) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis)):
   - Adds the ability get the base structure of a valid metadata item (with minimum required fields or all expanded fields), based on the current schema (either in the package data or from an argument-provided catalog). This functionality is contained in the new `schema_utils` module.
   - Updates required fields in schemas, specifically removing `name` from the list of required fields of the dataset schema and adding `metadata_sources` to the list of required fields of both the dataset and file schemas
- Adds ability for `schema_utils` to return a base metadata item with specific keys excluded. PR [#379](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/379) (by [@jsheunis](https://github.com/jsheunis))
- Have a single implementation of assigning sources by @yarikoptic. PR [#356](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/356)

# 1.0.1 (Fri Sept 1 2023) -- Brand new CLI!

### Summary

This is the first major release update since the initial release,
mainly due to breaking changes in the command line interface.

Most of the changes were included in https://github.com/datalad/datalad-catalog/pull/309,
summarised as:
- update API to entrypoint per command: `create`, `add`, `validate`, `serve`, `get`, `set`, `remove`, `translate`, `workflow`
- introduce `datalad-next` dependency, at first for constraint system but in future for whatever functionality is useful
- refactor most of the code related to the main commands

Some of the important changes to take note of:

- Validation is now done according to the schema of a specific catalog (now located at `path-to-catalog/schema/*`), where previously validation was always done according to the latest schema of the installed package version (which is now the fallback).
- Metadata can be passed to any catalog command that takes it as in argument, in different formats: json lines from STDIN, JSON-serialized string, and a file with JSON lines.
- pytest fixtures are now located in `tests/fixtures.py` and exposed to all tests
- `catalog-get|set` provides an extensible set of commands for configuring a catalog and reporting its properties
- the handling of config files is refactored:
   - The main changes relate to how/when a config file is provided.
   - Previously, config files were specified during instantiation of the WebCatalog class, and a whole lot of obscure code was necessary to determine how this config applies to the catalog or dataset level.
   - The refactored code receives the config file via the Create() and Add() commands or via the WebCatalog.create() or Node.add_attributes() python methods.
   - Now, WebCatalog can be instantiated with location alone (no 'action'  necessary anymore, and no config_file)
   - Now, config is set on WebCatalog or Node instances after/during  running their respective create() methods and not during instantiation
- Translation functionality is refactored, and *requires updated to existing translators*:
   - With the new catalog argument, translation occurs to the specific schema version of the catalog (if  supported by an available translator); if the catalog argument is not supplied, the expected schema version is the latest supported by the package installation.
   - The translator matching process is streamlined by keeping track of previously matched and instantiated translators
   - Functionality to get the supported schema version, source name, and source version have been moved to the translator base class in order to support the abovementioned changes. This means existing and new translators will have to override these functions.
