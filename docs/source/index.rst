NOTE: Future development
========================

We're working on a newer, leaner, more modular, and more interoperable solution
to the same challenge that the current ``datalad-catalog`` aims to address.
This new development is taking place within the broader context of making
DataLad datasets interoperable with linked and semantic (meta)data. For more
background, see `this issue`_. To keep up to date, follow progress at
`psychoinformatics-de/datalad-concepts`_, `psychoinformatics-de/shacl-vue`_, and
in the `new development branch`_. Because of this redirected focus, ``datalad-catalog``
itself will be downscaled by focusing on maintenance and assessing the priority
of new features on a case-by-case basis.
