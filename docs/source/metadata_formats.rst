Metadata and ``datalad-catalog``
********************************

The catalog is rendered from structured metadata generated by ``datalad-catalog``. In this
section, more information is provided about the nature of metadata (in general and in
relation to the catalog) and the states that metadata generally pass through in order to
end up as part of a catalog.

What is metadata?
=================

Metadata describe the files in your dataset, as well as its overall content.
Implicit metadata include basic descriptions of the data itself (such as the names,
types, sizes, and relative locations of all files in your dataset), while explicit
metadata items (such as a description of your dataset, its contributors and project
specifications) can be added to your dataset as you see fit. MetaLad provides functionality
for adding metadata items of arbitrary size, format, and amount, and does not impose
restrictions in this regard.

Many standards exist for specifying and structuring metadata. Some examples include:

- **DataCite**: The `DataCite Metadata Schema`_ is a list of core metadata properties
  chosen for an accurate and consistent identification of a resource for citation
  and retrieval purposes, along with recommended use instructions.
- **XMP**: The `Extensible Metadata Platform`_ is an ISO standard for the creation,
  processing and interchange of standardized and custom metadata for digital documents
  and data sets. It also provides guidelines for embedding XMP information into popular
  image, video and document file formats, such as JPEG and PDF.
- **Frictionless Data**: The `Frictionless Data Package`_ is a container format for
  describing a coherent collection of data in a single 'package', providing the basis
  for convenient delivery, installation and management of datasets.

Standardized file formats may also contain format-specific information (such as bit rate
and duration for audio files, or resolution and color mode for image files), while domain-
standard files (such as `Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine`_, i.e. DICOM)
also supply embedded or sidecar metadata.

.. note:: In order to create a user-friendly catalog, DataLad Catalog should receive 
    structured metadata adhering to a specified :doc:`catalog_schema` as input. This means
    that structured metadata first has to be sourced and then translated into the schema.


Metadata handling with MetaLad
==============================

Since ``datalad-catalog`` provides its own schema in a standard vocabulary,
any metadata that conforms to this schema can be submitted to the tool in order to
generate a catalog and its entries. Metadata items do not necessarily have to be derived
from DataLad datasets, and the metadata extraction does not have to be conducted via
``datalad-metalad``. However, ``datalad-metalad`` provides highly applicable functionality
that simplifies the process of metadata handling for the purpose of generating structured
outputs that could be used for catalog generation.

``datalad-metalad`` has functionality to:

- ``add`` metadata of an arbitrary format to a DataLad dataset
- ``dump`` metadata that was previously added to a DataLad dataset
- ``extract`` metadata from files or datasets using format-specific extractors

as well as to run batch jobs with these and other methods. Find out more about MetaLad and
its capabilities in the dedicated `DataLad Handbook Chapter`_.

The benefit of using ``datalad-metalad`` in a catalog-generation workflow comes with the
use of its extraction interface and custom extractors. An extractor is nothing other than
something that understands a specific schema (or data structure) and can *extract* information
from a file or dataset that adheres to said schema. For example, the ``metalad_core``
extractor that ships with ``datalad-metalad`` can extracting implicit metadata, such as author
information, dataset identifier/version, bytesize (for files), and more, from a DataLad dataset
and its files. And the ``metalad_studyminimeta`` extractor extracts information from DataLad
dataset containing a ``.studyminimeta.yaml`` file in its root directory. MetaLad ships with
a variety of dataset- and file-level extractors, and so does a number of DataLad extensions
including ``datalad-catalog``. If an extractor for a specific metadata format is not available
a custom extractor can be created and provided via a DataLad extension. If this sounds like
something you need, please refer to the documentation on `writing your own extractor`_.

An extractor will output its metadata, which has a structure specified by the dedicated
extractor, inside a wrapper object provided by ``datalad-metalad``. This means the top-level
structure of all metadata extracted by ``datalad-metalad`` will be the same, while that of the
property containing the actual extracted metadata will differ based on the extractor.


Metadata translation
====================

As mentioned above, ``datalad-catalog`` provides its own schema in a standard vocabulary,
and incoming metadata need to validate successfully against this schema. Since extracted
metadata will typically be structured according to whatever schema was specified by the
extractor, and information in such a schema will first have to be translated to the catalog
schema before catalog entry generation can continue.

``datalad-catalog`` provides a ``catalog-translate`` command through which custom translators
can be created and used to translate MetaLad-extracted metadata into the catalog schema.
The catalog ships with several translators (including ones for ``metalad_core`` and 
``metalad_studyminimeta``) and provides a base class that makes it straightforward to 
implement custom translators. Before translation from a specific source will work,
the extractor-specific translator should be provided and exposed as an entry point
(via a DataLad extension) as part of the ``datalad.metadata.translators`` group.

Then ``datalad-catalog`` will be able to find the correct traslator automatically
based on unique properties in a MetaLad-extracted metadata object. This is done by applying
matching criteria that is specified by the translator, and running a ``translate()`` method
if the match was successful.


The Catalog Schema
==================

Finally, the result of the metadata extraction and translation workflow will be metadata
that conforms to the catalog's own schema, which uses the vocabulary defined by `JSON Schema`_
(specifically `draft 2020-12`_). Find out more about the :doc:`catalog_schema`.
